# E-commerce Data Analysis Projects using SQL and Python
### Overview
This project aims to perform comprehensive data analysis on an e-commerce database using SQL and Python. The database consists of multiple tables that contain information about customers, geolocation, order items, orders, payments, products, and sellers. The analysis covers basic, intermediate, and advanced queries to extract meaningful insights from the data. The project also demonstrates the process of importing data into MySQL using Python and connecting Jupyter notebooks with MySQL for interactive data analysis.
